# USA Minesweeper
My first major project: a GUI-based minesweeper game with USA flags as the mine markers. The program consists of 4 classes and 1 interface. There are also 11 image files used within the program. The images can be found among the java files. There is also a non-applet runnable minesweeper.jar which can be downloaded and used to play the game.
